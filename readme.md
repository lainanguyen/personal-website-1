This is my first attempt at creating a personal website.

The majority of the project was done with HTML5 and CSS3, with a little bit of Javascript.

My goal for this project was to familiarize myself with HTML and CSS basics and create a web portfolio that employers can use to view my resume.
This goal was achieved as I spent a lot of time reviewing concepts such as divs, links, images, and more. This also made me realize the importance of organizing your code so that it is readable and tracable.

A challenge that I had was working with CSS units regarding the sizing of each subject. As you can see, with full screen everything functions normally but when the screen is minimized, things start shifting around, making the website poorly formatted.
To combat this, I am learning CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid to figure out proportions of sizing which will be applied in my next attempt at this project.
